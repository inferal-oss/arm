# ARM delivery plan

The complete product scope is [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md). This plan records current
technical ownership, accepted milestones, dependencies and remaining gates.
Implemented behavior and scoped evidence are detailed in
[IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) and [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).
A completed milestone does not establish full specification coverage.

## Integration policy

The coordinator owns shared module, schema, backend, CLI and documentation
integration. Implementations and independent reviews use separate branches and
worktrees. Review actual final source, fix findings, and validate affected
compositions before committing focused features. Preserve unfinished work.
Owner completion reports and passing checks on earlier source are insufficient.
Keep private task-routing and execution records outside this repository.

Unknown resource, process, transport or filesystem outcomes retain obligations.
No lookup-only receipt, context deadline or process exit alone proves cleanup.
Production fences remain until their explicit acceptance gates pass.

## Accepted recent milestones

| Area | Integrated commit | Supported boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Peer discovery | `975d4b9` | Advisory held/queued resources; discovery is not admission authority. |
| Source sync | `c64a49c` | Original-owner private source worker and charged frame. |
| CPU warnings | `113f738` | Warning-only runtime with scoped model, actual-trace and proof evidence. |
| TCP forwarding foundation | `5ecd9f7` | Leased named-service and bounded-relay foundation; ordinary builds remain disabled. |
| Kubernetes runtime | `ebbc6da` | Authenticated runtime/catalog eligibility and reconciliation gates. |
| Standard Mac screen | `228ccff` | Scoped direct-peer Standard VNC support. |
| Sync recovery | `f60c8c3` | Strict read-only recovery evidence; no inferred reclamation. |
| Schema diagnostics | `1e7b390` | Readable incompatible-schema refusal without repair. |
| Charm peer views | `d7fab97` | Native peer/resource views with reviewed interaction behavior. |
| Explicit database forgetting | `181a776` | Intentional local ledger loss after stopped-daemon, path and inventory checks; no external cleanup or secure-media erasure. |
| Canonical module | `77b962f` | Installable `github.com/inferal-oss/arm`, in-module audited rsync fork, ZIP-visible licensed browser assets. |
| Sync workspace evidence | `b50d15b` | Durable reservation/root markers and bounded read-only multiple-workspace lookup. |
| Kubernetes admission | `1a75e10` | Exact standard tolerations, incomplete-affinity refusal and rejection of injected image credentials. |
| PSS observation | `998eb96` | Advisory Linux proportional resident counters with identity/quality bounds; no admission or pressure credit. |
| Pressure control model | `3cd8aec` | Finite one-execution fence and retained-obligation abstraction; no Go refinement or native pause enablement. |
| Original-child and SSH settlement | `29000b2` / `bd5a7f0` / `78feee0` | Original signal authority retires before the sole wait; native/transport uncertainty retains charges, including an ending-journal refusal. Sleep/wake remains separate. |
| Elapsed lease entitlement | `f890971` | Boot-scoped suspend-inclusive native deadlines, held-work revalidation and audit-only wall expiry; physical suspend and provider/pressure composition remain separate. |
| Cgroup memory | `128d08e` | Complete visible Linux cgroup-v2 ancestry caps memory headroom; uncertain scopes provide no admission credit. |
| Development forwarding clients | `4e8bdb4` | Bounded HTTP/raw clients with admission cancellation fixes; production remains disabled. |
| Forwarding local TLS | `9e5309d` | Exact local mesh certificate pin before bearer/application data; production remains disabled. |
| Durable provider fixture | `5d5a423` / `4fcdd46` | Opt-in SQLite external-object lifecycle, immutable intent and crash/retry evidence; no production registration or admission. |
| Relay process-loss validation | `35fd1e0` | Native three-node CLI fault fixture checks one effect, unknown outcome, original-child joins and retained relay charge; no physical partition or production claim. |
| Aggregate forwarding credit | `c3e1b77` | Required reviewed total bytes, durable prepayment across streams/directions and crash-retained history; production remains disabled. |
| Relay cleanup uncertainty | `7430c86` | Exact original holder retains charges after native cleanup errors, even after worker join/restart. |
| Workspace ledger | `951051a` | Durable locators before staging, strict schema version 2 and read-only legacy/current reset proof. |
| Terminal gauges | `0ec2b57` | Coherent receipt clocks, stale-click protection and native gauge/PTY evidence. |
| Receiver staging bounds | `1df2f18` / `353f860` | Plan-derived reconstruction cap, exact original transport abort and complete immutable workspace checkpoints; no physical quota. |
| Screen transport retention | `30ae7b2` / `0d341aa` | Cooperative .05 CPU/8MiB charge through original socket close and positive worker joins; uncertain cleanup retains charge through restart. |
| Workspace block survey | `64ceec0` | Bounded read-only reported blocks; no reservation or reclamation authority. |
| Native quota diagnostics | `8ee02ba` / `3d8b85d` | Read-only existing-scope APFS/XFS reports with strict parsing and identity bounds; no complete-scope, admission or enforcement authority. |
| Semblance browser UI | `412e35a` / `4bfe291` | Stock Semblance graph UI, offline WAT bundle and guarded eight-view navigation; scoped native/browser acceptance, with platform hint and upstream PRs still pending. |
| Literal public latest | Reviewed `9ccd7da`, run `40449550928` | Actual macOS/Linux cold-cache latest install of published `81fdccd`, exact provenance/checksums and source/helper closure; earlier `4e8bdb4` evidence remains historical. |
| Public module validation | `ef6c637` | Source-bound public query/install checks and bounded original-child cleanup; descendant cleanup on interruption remains unproven. |

Earlier reviewed backend, policy, agent messaging, storage, native lifecycle,
remaining-capacity views, routed SSH and carrier milestones retain the scopes
recorded in IMPLEMENTATION and VALIDATION. Do not reimport old divergent branch
history merely because it contains an earlier ready report.

## Active portfolios

| Owner role / branch | Current step | Remaining work and acceptance gates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resource safety — `codex/resource-safety-cgroup-memory` | Memory and PSS observation (`998eb96`) milestones integrated with independently reviewed native usage and current policy/reset evidence. Finite pressure-control model `3cd8aec` is integrated with a weakened-fence counterexample. | PSS is observation only and supplies no admission or pressure credit. The model assumes positive external cleanup and does not validate native process control or production Go. Broaden sound CPU/resident/shared attribution and platform evidence; supervised pressure pause/resume must retain RAM/disk obligations and never signal unrelated processes. Complete elapsed-clock adapters and pressure-specific runtime/formal gates. |
| Bidirectional sync — `codex/public-sync-delivery` | Planner, private worker, workspace markers and read-only recovery integrated. Workspace ledger and bounded read-only block survey are reviewed and integrated with native Linux/macOS evidence. Diagnostic quota milestone `8ee02ba` is integrated with source review, focused macOS evidence and Linux compilation only. | Fresh schema version 2, exact legacy/current read-only reset proof, bounded locators and write-before-staging records are supported. Schema version 1 startup is incompatible and is never repaired or migrated. Receiver staging cap, original-carrier abort and exact complete workspace checkpoints are reviewed and integrated (`1df2f18`, `353f860`, `2efd1bb`). Native enforcement contract `8567aa9` specifies the next boundary; it does not supply a quota. The enforcing-scope API remains a proposal, including a sealed cross-package proof bridge and charged native coverage before any preparation/name-policy write. Native quota-positive and allocation-refusal fixtures remain absent. Ordinary strict reset needs settlement proof; accepted explicit `--forget` remains intentional ledger abandonment without external cleanup credit. Physical reservations, complete exclusive quota coverage, public/relayed dispatch, conflict/deletion policy, cleanup/settlement, performance and formal acceptance remain. |
| Multi-hop TCP forwarding — `codex/forward-usable-clients` | Development clients and source-listener TLS binding are integrated with actual Linux/macOS three-node evidence; ordinary builds stay disabled. | Preserve default-off fence. Aggregate byte-credit milestone `c3e1b77` is integrated with exact native runtime and causal control evidence. One owned-relay process-death case is reviewed (`35fd1e0`); physical network partition, cross-host/platform, browser/unmodified-client and formal gates remain. Suspend-aware checks must also cover policy I/O before returning a positive grant. The separately tagged Unix adapter prototype stays isolated pending error-path fixes, bounded local connections, original Manager/clock authority, filesystem policy and durable recovery; its native fixture does not establish real CLI/TLS/READY integration. Cancellation and interim-response fixes do not establish full forwarding delivery. |
| Kubernetes — `codex/kubernetes-pod-workflow` | Admission milestone integrated; separate live Pod Ready and exact-UID cleanup evidence. | Private-carrier export remains blocked. A separate public-source build plan includes the full source tree and normal CPU queue. Pre-create cleanup ownership, complete preferred-API namespace inventory and exact original-Pod-UID Event handling need focused validation before execution. No create attempt may authorize deletion of a pre-existing object. In-Pod catalog/identity proof, enrollment and pinned SSH remain unverified. Hidden native CPU/quota authority stays fail closed. |
| Mac screen — `codex/mac-screen-standard-gates` | Original resource holds passed native scope; a confirmed native-close error exposed premature settlement. Generic retention API `7430c86` is integrated; caller correction is reviewed and integrated through `0d341aa`. | Native Linux/macOS exact-close failure retains the same charge through join, bounded close and actual reopen; final normal-flow/source gates pass. Preserve genuine native-capacity refusals. Standard live/control/clipboard/other-user/revocation/multihop and High Performance breadth remain. |
| Sleep/wake and operations — `codex/lease-suspend-clock-runtime` | Original-child/SSH/End prerequisite and elapsed lease milestone `f890971` are integrated. Final local macOS passes 205 roots/379 named cases; corrected policy-loader Linux passes 13 affected roots/19 cases with exact causal negatives. Strict proof passes 19 obligations in five roots at its recorded source. | Preserve the earlier broader/source-specific cohorts and failed hosted macOS results. No physical hardware/VM suspend or hard kernel preemption is claimed. Compose trusted elapsed authority into provider and pressure adapters; complete remaining operational configuration, services, degraded persistence, retention, restore and overhead. Broader formal/runtime coverage remains separate from the accepted one-allocation clock model. |
| Providers/workloads — `codex/managed-provider-protocol` | Durable opt-in executable fixture and independent native/source review integrated (`5d5a423`, `4fcdd46`). Entitlement-consumer candidate `2b49dd1` is under independent review. | Fix the cancelled-retry versus grant-publication race at one atomic publication cut and add a causal concurrent regression. Adapt trusted elapsed entitlement after the clock contract is frozen; revalidate before native start and grant publication. The real Manager/clock/durable-admission bridge remains unimplemented. Broaden registration/admission, real workloads, GPU/network resources and distributed authority. |
| Terminal gauges — `codex/terminal-gauge-availability` | Reviewed clock-cut fix and mouse-frame/event-order corrections integrated from `70306d3`; native Linux/macOS gauges and both PTYs pass. | Preserve genuine unknown observations and backend-derived To-lease values. Native app GUI, all host environments and later elapsed-clock composition remain separate gates. |
| Product browser UI — `codex/semblance-web-migration` | Major reviewed migration `412e35a` is integrated: two identical WAT-only builds, 325 policy cases, 19 unique RDF cases, 45 native server roots/81 named cases, compiled bootstrap/PTY/ZIP and 16 actual desktop/narrow views. Private islands and exact session integers are corrected. | Finish the separately queued host platform marker so the macOS shortcut hint matches native Command+K, and bind acceptance to its changed assets. Prepare the four actual reusable-component PRs against current upstream; issues alone are not PRs. Preserve scoped evidence: controlled UI policies and local actions do not accept every real remote/Kubernetes/SSH/clipboard workflow or later elapsed-clock composition. Stock Semblance is the approved default; Terminal remains selectable. |
| Public site and releases — `codex/arm-public-launch` | Semblance/System site and tagged-carrier workflow composed on accepted canonical source; four-carrier builds and Pages screenshots passed their frozen-source checks; original-child and callback-reaper corrections are reviewed. Frozen `c24a4d6` artifact integrity is accepted: all 16 compressed occurrences and four unique raw payload hashes, sizes and actual Go metadata match. | Final accepted product-UI composition, refreshed exact-source artifacts/screenshots, Pages publication and both HTTPS endpoints remain open. Historical artifact inspection does not accept later source or deploy anything. Configure only DNS-only GitHub Pages apex records; no additional Cloudflare hosting or proxying. GitHub Pages custom-hostname limits must be reported truthfully. |
| Module distribution — `codex/canonical-module-distribution` | Production migration and corrected validation harness integrated. | Native run `40449550928` accepts literal latest at published `81fdccd` on macOS arm64 and Linux amd64, with exact selected-version/full-origin/checksum binding, actual install/buildinfo/ZIP closure and separate immutable source/helper snapshots before and after. Earlier `40442560813` remains scoped to `4e8bdb4`. Preserve the original failed Origin assertion. Later publication or module/layout changes need source-bound validation; this evidence does not claim installation of later commits. |

## Shared dependency order

1. Keep canonical module/fork layout and licensed asset relocation in all new
   compositions. Adapt only feature-owned new imports; do not restore local
   replacements, nested modules or ZIP-omitted vendor asset directories.
2. Integrate reviewed focused sync, forwarding and gauge steps independently
   when their actual gates pass. Keep public sync and production forwarding
   disabled until their broader resource/security/lifecycle gates pass.
3. Preserve the accepted suspend-inclusive elapsed lease contract and
   original-child lifecycle primitive. Finish provider and pressure composition;
   new execution, SSH, sync, forwarding and screen paths must consume validated
   native remaining time rather than serialized wall deadlines or Go timers.
4. Preserve source-server authentication and clock guards when composing new
   forwarding clients. A token sent to a loopback port does not authenticate
   the process that currently owns that port.
5. Complete tagged-release identity injection using canonical package paths.
   Each released platform carrier contains four thin companion payloads, with
   exact tag/source/checksum evidence and no recursive catalogs. No tag or
   release is created by validation alone.
6. Publish reviewed main source, then independently verify ordinary public
   installation. Immutable-query success is not literal-latest acceptance.

## Remaining specification coverage

Continue the full local admission and recovery model: nested budgets, complete
resource bundles, known-impossibility/FIFO revalidation, conservative native
observations, concurrency, persistent audit and accurate unknown states. Physical
storage ownership/reclamation, shared memory and kernel enforcement retain their
explicit limits. Capability-driven GPU/network and multi-host global pools need
real authority and partition/recovery acceptance; local accounting is not a
distributed allocation proof.

Preserve existing agent catalog, instruction integration, sender-aware delivery,
check-ins and operator messaging while broadening real adapter/version coverage,
remote identity and delivery/retry policy. Replies or silence do not renew leases.
Complete installation/services/uninstall/restore and operational retention without
erasing active obligations or adopting foreign processes/files.

Maintain CLI/web/Charm operational parity, host selection, reviewed controls,
keyboard/mouse/resize/reconnect behavior and accessible stock components. Product
web defaults to Semblance; the public site defaults to Semblance/System.

Expand bounded TLA+ safety/liveness models, actual Go trace comparison and strict
proof obligations across graph freshness/recovery, SSH settlement, sync
reconciliation/deletion/recovery, provider lifecycle and elapsed-clock behavior.
Toolchain health or a component proof does not accept a composed runtime.
Retained workspace-clock and provider formal experiments remain scoped research
until their original complete gates pass.

QUIC (`d115a84`) is parked research, not a dependency of non-research delivery.
Older mounted-share experiments are superseded by the sync direction and are
not reactivated by retaining their technical records.

Heavy local validation uses the shared Semblance test-queue script with its
normal FIFO/slot/worker/time bounds. Its reviewed liveness correction retains
unknown/permission-denied tickets and refuses dispatch if its own ticket is
missing. Preserve unrelated checkouts and externally held capacity; never infer
passing validation from a queued, interrupted or missing original command.

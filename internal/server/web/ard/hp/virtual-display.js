 * High Performance mode — asking the server for a virtual display.
 *
 * Apple's viewer sends this message (type 0x1d) before SetEncodings when it
 * wants High Performance on a virtual display. The server then creates a
 * display with the modes listed, sends the video at its pixel resolution,
 * and reports its size in points. Without the message the server shares its
 * real displays.

 * The server keeps a display it has made while a viewer of that user
 * remains, and for some seconds after. A later request changes the mode of
 * that display, but never to one wider or taller in pixels than the largest
 * size it was made with: the server then gives fewer pixels than asked, or
 * keeps the old size and sends no picture.
